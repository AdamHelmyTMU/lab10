  <h3>Lab 10 – Problem 2 Framework and Host (MaterializeCSS + GitHub pages)</h3>

  <h5>How I installed everything</h5>
  <p>
    I chose to use the MaterializeCSS for my front end framework. I could just
    include a CDN link on the top and have access to the styling without any further
    installation.
  </p>

  <h5>How I built the page</h5>
  <p>
    This page is a simple html file with a button component from MaterializeCSS to 
    confirm it was implemented properly. I then just simply hosted it on GitHub pages
    by following a quick tutorial video.
  </p>

  <h5>Difficulties encountered</h5>
  <p>
    The difficulty here was honestly having too many options and trying to figure out a simple
    solution took most of my time. I knew GitHub pages was simple, I've just never used it adn same with MaterializeCSS,
    never used anything like it so took me a minute.

  <h5>Example Materialize Component</h5>
  <a class="waves-effect waves-light btn">Materialize Button</a>
